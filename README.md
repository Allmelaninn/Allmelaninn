Experienced Cybersecurity 
-------------------------------------------

As a Cybersecurity Analyst at CyberAI innovation, I've combined my deep-rooted expertise in healthcare with advanced cybersecurity techniques to safeguard critical and sensitive data in the face of ever-escalating cyber threats. Armed with a (ISC)² Certified in Cybersecurity credential and a CCMA degree from Kaplan University, I stand at the confluence of healthcare and technology, uniquely poised to address vulnerabilities and threats specific to healthcare IT.

With a foundational background in healthcare, including over three years as a CCMA Lead at Healor and nine months at VillageMD, I've cultivated strong clinical and administrative competencies. From training medical professionals and managing intricate patient flows to directly assisting physicians with procedures and employing diagnostic tools, I've always been drawn to the integral role of technology in optimizing healthcare processes.

Now, as I navigate the cybersecurity landscape, my hands-on experience in healthcare positions me to uniquely understand and address the nuanced challenges the medical industry faces in terms of IT security. My aspiration is to bridge the gap between medical expertise and cybersecurity, ensuring that as healthcare continues its rapid digital transformation, it remains fortified against cyber threats.

In this dynamic environment of healthcare IT security, I'm eager to further apply my analytical acumen and domain-specific knowledge, creating robust security architectures and strategies that ensure patient data integrity and trust.
